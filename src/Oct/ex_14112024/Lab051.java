   the expression a % b calculates the remainder of the division of a by b.

Here's how it works for a = 10 and b = 12:

Division: When you divide 10 by 12, the quotient is 0 because 12 cannot fit into 10.
Remainder: The remainder is what is left after multiplying the quotient by b. In this case, 0 * 12 = 0. Therefore, the remainder is 10 - 0 = 10.
So, 10 % 12 evaluates to 10 because 10 is less than 12, and when you divide 10 by 12, the entire 10 is left as the remainder.

To summarize:

10 / 12 gives a quotient of 0
Remainder = 10 - (0 * 12) = 10
Thus, 10 % 12 results in 10.
